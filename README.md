Features:
Randomized Color Sequence: The game generates a random sequence of colors that the player must repeat.
Increasing Difficulty: Each level adds a new color to the sequence, progressively testing the player's memory.
Game Over and High Score: Displays a "Game Over" message and keeps track of the highest score achieved during the session.
Interactive Animations: Buttons flash and respond to user clicks with smooth animations for better user experience.

Technologies Used:
HTML5 for structuring the game layout.
CSS3 for styling and animations (e.g., flashing buttons).
JavaScript for game logic, including sequence generation, user input validation, and score tracking.

How to Play:
Click the "Start" button to begin the game.
